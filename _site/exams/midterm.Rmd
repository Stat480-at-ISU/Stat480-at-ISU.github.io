## Tracking the Global Outbreak of COVID-19

The coronavirus pandemic has sickened more than 1.4 million people, according to official counts. Here, we will explore both the global and local growth of COVID-19 using data sourced on April 8th, 2020.


### Part I: Recovery data

This data set contains information on some of the first fully recovered cases of COVID-19. We will look at the time it took these patients to recover, defined as the number of days between a confirmed test and an official discharge date. The data is available at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat480-at-ISU/Stat480-at-ISU.github.io/master/exams/data/covid19-recovered.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat480-at-ISU/Stat480-at-ISU.github.io/master/exams/data/covid19-recovered.csv)

#### Question #1: An overview

(i) Read the data without downloading the file locally. 

```{r}
recovery_data <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat480-at-ISU/Stat480-at-ISU.github.io/master/exams/data/covid19-recovered.csv")
```


(ii) A first look:  
      - What are the dimensions of the data?  
      - What variables are included and what are their types?

```{r}
## your answer here
```


#### Question #2: Some wrangling

In order to continue with an analysis of this data, we should make some modifications to it.

(i) Use functions from the `tidyverse` package to make the following modifications:  
    - Convert the variables `confirmed` and  `discharged` into variables of type "date".  
    - Extract the numeric value from the variable `recovery`.  
    - Re-derive the variable `recovery` as the number of days between `confirmed` and `discharged` and save as `recovery_days`.  
    - Convert the variable `category` from type `character` to type `factor`.  
    - Save this data as `recovered` and use this data for the remaining questions in part I.  

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(ii) Look at a summary of the variables:

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(iii) What was the longest amount of time someone represented in this data took to recover from COVID-19? Which observation was this? Use indexing to print this row of the data frame.

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(iv) When was the first confirmed case in this data? Which observation is this? Use indexing to print this row of the data frame.

```{r}
## your answer here
```


#### Question #4: Time to recovery

If indeed infected, how long would it take for you to be free of the novel coronavirus?   

(i) Use `ggplot2` to look at the distribution of the variable `recovery` (you may need to adjust the size of the bins).

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(ii) Is there a difference in the time it took to recover for different ages?   
      - Create a new variable `age_blks` from `age` that introduces age categories that groups the ages of the patients into intervals: < 10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, and >80. (see ?cut).  
      - Create side-by-side boxplots of the number of days to recovery for the different age groups.   
      - Flip the coordinates and map the variable `age_blks` to the fill aesthetic.

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(iii) Is there a difference between the genders in the time it took to recover for any of the groups?  
      - Use the age blocks created in the last question.  
      - Create side-by-side boxplots for males and females (1's and 0's, respectively) for each of the age groups. 
      - Fill your boxplots by mapping the variable `gender` to the aesthetic `fill`.

```{r}
## your answer here
```



### Part II: Global Data

#### Question #1: First Overview

(i) Read the data from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat480-at-ISU/Stat480-at-ISU.github.io/master/exams/data/covid19-global.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat480-at-ISU/Stat480-at-ISU.github.io/master/exams/data/covid19-global.csv) without downloading the file locally. Each line of the file contains daily counts for Province/State-County/Region pair.

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(ii) How many rows and columns does the data have? 

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(iii) What are the variables called?

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(iv) Rename the variables `Province/State`, `Country/Region`, `Lat`, and `Long` to be `province`, `country`, `lat`, and `long`, respectively.

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(v) Each row contains data for one province-country pair. How many countries are represented in this data set? 

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(vi) For each country represented, how many provinces are recorded? Print a table for the five countries with the largest number of provinces recorded.

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(vii) How many countries do not have any provinces recorded in this data?

```{r}
## your answer here
```


#### Question #2: Data wrangling

In order to continue with an analysis of this data, we should reshape it.

(i) Use functions from the `tidyverse` package to modify the shape and form of the data:  
    - Use a function from `dplyr` to remove the `lat` and `long` variables from the `cases` data.   
    - Then use a function from the `tidyr` package to move from wide format into long format where each row represents the number of confirmed cases on a particular date for each country-province pair.  
    - Lastly, use a function from `lubridate` to convert the variable `date` from a string into an object of type `date`.  
    - Save the resulting data frame as `cases_long`.  

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(ii) Identify the nine countries with the largest number of confirmed cases and save these in a data frame named `cases_by_country`. Plan of attack:  
      - Begin with the data frame `cases_long`.  
      - Calculate the number of confirmed cases for each country on each date.  
      - Find the rank of the countries by current number of confirmed cases for each country.  
      - Filter the top nine countries.  
      - Save this data frame as `cases_by_country`.  

```{r}
## your answer here
```



#### Question #3: Growth over time

(i) Let's look at how the number confirmed cases for these nine countries grew over time.  
    - Start with the data frame `cases_by_country.`  
    - Use `ggplot2` to plot the number of confirmed cases for each of the nine countries over time.  
    - Map the variable `country` to color and use the function `fct_reorder2()` from the `forcats` package to align the colors of the lines with the colors in the legend. 
    - Optional: to make the y-axis labels more readable, add the layer `+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)`.  

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(ii) Let's next look at the difference the last week of March made (Mar 24 vs. Mar 31).  
      - Use `ggplot2` to create a barchart of the number of cases for the top nine countries for the two dates, sorted according to the total number of cases in that country.
      - Make sure the labels of the bars are readable and fill by country.

```{r}
## your answer here
```


#### Question #4: Some summaries

(i) How many days did it take for each of the nine countries to go from their 500th case to their 20,000th case?

```{r}
## your answer here
```


(ii) Let's take another look at how the number of cases has grown. This time, though, let's look at the growth for each country starting at their 100th case.  
      - For each country, calculate the first date that the country had 100 or more cases.  
      - Introduce a new variable that transforms the date variable into the number of days since the 100th case.  
      - Save this data frame as `cases100`.  
      - Create a subset of the `cases100` that contains only the last date and save as `cases100_last`.
      - Extra credit: Using `cases100` and `cases100_last`, recreate the visualization below.
