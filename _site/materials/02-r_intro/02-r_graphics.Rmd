## Questions for the fbi data

---
## Plan for answers

- Explore how one (or more) variables are distributed: *barchart or histogram*

- Explore how two variables are related:  *scatterplot, boxplot, tile plot*

- Explore how two variables are related, conditioned on other variables: *facetting, color & other aesthetics*

---
## Different version of the data

We will use a different shape of the `fbi` data - a wide form:

```{r}
library(classdata)
str(fbiwide)
```

---
## Scatterplots

- need two continuous variables

- we'll be using the `ggplot2` framework for plotting

# Why `ggplot2`?

## Why `ggplot2`

- Wildly popular package for statistical graphics: over 2.5 million downloads from CRAN in 2017 (several thousand times per day)

- Developed by Hadley Wickham (An ISU Alumni)

- Designed to adhere to good graphical practices

- Constructs plots using the concept of layers

- Supports a wide variety plot types and extensions

- http://ggplot2.org/book/ or Hadley's book *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis* for reference

## Grammar of Graphics

A graphical representation (plot) consists of:

1. **mappings** (`aes`):  data variables are mapped to graphical elements

2. **layers**:  geometric elements (`geoms`, such as points, lines, rectangles, text, ...) and statistical transformations (`stats`, are identity, counts, bins, ...)

3. **scales**: map values in the data space to values in an aesthetic space (e.g. color, size, shape, but also position)

4. **coordinate system** (`coord`): normally Cartesian, but pie charts use e.g. polar coordinates

5. **facetting**: for small multiples (subsets) and their arrangement

6. **theme**: fine-tune display items, such as font and its size, color of background, margins, ...

## Scatterplots in `ggplot2`

- `aes` allows us to specify mappings

- scatterplots need a mapping for `x` and a mapping for `y`:

<br/>

```
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = Burglary, y = Murder)) +
  geom_point()
```  

```
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Murder))) +
  geom_point()
```  

```
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft))) +
  geom_point()
```

## Revision - Interpreting Scatterplots

- Big patterns

  - Form and direction

  - Strength

- Small patterns

- Deviations from the pattern

  - Outliers
    
---
<br/><br/>
 
#### **Form**

Is the plot linear?  Is the plot curved?  Is there a distinct pattern in the plot? Are there multiple groups?

#### **Strength**

Does the plot follow the form very closely?  Or is there a lot of variation?   

#### **Direction**

Is the pattern increasing?  Is the plot decreasing?

- **Positively**: Above (below) average in one variable tends to be associated with above (below) average in another variable.

- **Negatively**: Opposite pattern.

## Aesthetics

Can map other variables to size or colour
<br/>

```
ggplot(aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft),
           colour=State), data=fbiwide) + geom_point()

ggplot(aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft),
           colour=Year), data=fbiwide) + geom_point()
```

```
ggplot(aes(x = log(Burglary), y = log(Motor.vehicle.theft),
           size=Population), data=fbiwide) + geom_point()
```
