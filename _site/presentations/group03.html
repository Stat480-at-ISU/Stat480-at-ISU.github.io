<h2>Flying data</h2>

<p>We used this data set in class for a few things. We will make sure not to talk about attitudes towards seat reclining or whether it is rude to bring a baby on a plane. Instead we will look at things such as attitudes towards armrest usage, waking people up so you can get up among others. </p>
