<h3>Analyzing police deaths in America</h3>

<p>For our final project, we will use the police_deaths dataset from the fivethirty eight package to examine how and why police deaths happen, both historically and over time. The following variables will be analyzed from the dataset: cause_of_death, date, year, canine, dept_name, and state. Some questions that we will answer include whether or not there are any spikes in different causes of death over time, what the most common causes of death are and if they have changed over the years, and which state has had the most police officer/canine deaths.</p>
