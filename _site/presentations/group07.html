<h3>Life Expectancy in the U.S.</h3>

<p>Life expectancy is a statistical measure as to how long one is expected to live. The overall population health of a country can often be determined through life expectancy. Life expectancy is a complex variable affected by many different factors. This can include living standards, lifestyles, education, health, and many others. For our analysis, we would like to take a closer look at the life expectancy in the United States and understand which factors affect life expectancy in the country. Using data collected by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we intend to investigate the average, highest, and lowest life expectancy in the United States. Then, we intend to investigate further by looking into the life expectancy of each county within each state. Since the dataset provided by CDC are merely estimates, we then would like to investigate the accuracy of data presented by the CDC, by evaluating the standard errors provided in the dataset.</p>
