<h2>Severity and Location of Traffic Accidents in the U.S.</h2>

<p>We will investigate a dataset based on U.S. traffic
accidents from February 2016 to December 2019. We will look into
questions about which areas of the U.S. have the most incidents and
which areas of the U.S. have the most severe accidents. These areas
can be investigated on different levels for state, city, county and
exact location. Additionally, we can investigate the relation between
the duration of these accidents with severity and location. Since the
dataset is large, if we have problems with runtime we will investigate
specifically for Iowa.</p>
