<h2>Classic Rock</h2>

<p>Our project will work with the classic rock song list dataset found inside the FiveThirtyEight R Library. It was created by Walt Hickey by listening to 25 classic rock stations in 30 large metropolitan areas for one week in June of 2017. He recorded and cleaned the data, his final dataset contained 2,229 unique songs by 475 artists. The dataset contains the following variables song,artist,release year, combined (song title + artist), has_year (boolean checking if there is a release year), playcount, and playcount_has_year (the playcount * has_year). With this data we will be exploring all Classic Rock songs popularity by a few different metrics like artist and year. A deeper look can be taken at some of musicâ€™s most influential bands like The Rolling Stones or The Beatles and what songs have the most replayability on today's radio. </p>
