  <h3>COVID-19 UPDATES:<br/></h3>

<p><br/><br/>
  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ISU has decided to move all courses to virtual instruction for the remainder of the spring semester. Hence, some adjustments will need to be made to our class schedule. <br/><br/><br/>
  The following changes have been made:
<ul>
<li>The midterm is now scheduled for April 9th, though the distribution format has yet to be decided.</li>
<li>The class schedule has now been updated and the links to slides will be added weekly.</li>
<li>The lecture format is TBD. Please respond to the survey sent out on <a href="https://canvas.iastate.edu/">canvas</a> by Monday, March 23rd.</li>
<li>The office hour format is TBD. If you have any questions regarding the material, please email the me or the TA or post the question as a discussion item on <a href="https://canvas.iastate.edu/">canvas</a>.</li>
<li>The plan for final group projects has not changed. I will provide more information on how we will do this at a distance in the next couple of weeks.</li>

    </ul>

  <h4>Course description:</h4>
  <p>Not all data lives in nice, clean spreadsheets, not all data fits in a computer's main memory. As statisticians we cannot always rely on other people and sciences to get the data into formats that we can deal with: we will discuss aspects of statistical computing as they are relevant for data analysis. Read and work with data in different formats: flat files, databases, web technologies. Elements of literate programming help us with making our workflow transparent and analyses reproducible. We will discuss how to communicate our results in form of R packages and interactive web applications.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    <h4>Learn how to:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Learn how to deal with complex, messy, real data</li>
<li>Use graphics to explore and understand data</li>
<li>Gain familiarity with basic data collection, storage and manipulation</li>
<li>Fluently reshape data into the most convenient form for analysis or reporting</li>
<li>Automate cleaning and analysis in R.</li>
    </ul>
