  <h3>COVID-19 UPDATES:<br/></h3>

<p>(as of 3/24)<br/><br/><br/>
  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ISU has decided to move all courses to virtual instruction for the remainder of the spring semester. Below is a summary of the changes that will need to be made to our class structure. <br/><br/><br/>
  
Regarding lectures:
<ul>
<li>The class schedule has now been updated and the links to slides will be added weekly.</li>
<li>The lectures will be held as a Zoom meeting at the usual lecture time. Please check the home page for our class on <a href="https://canvas.iastate.edu/">canvas</a> for instructions on how to access the Zoom meeting. I will send out recordings of the lectures after the lecture is complete. Please note, this format is subject to change as I am evaluating this process day by day.</li>
<li>To encourage you to stay on schedule, I would like you to submit your "your turn" attempts on canvas within 48 hours of the scheduled lecture time. If, for whatever reason, you are unable to complete the exercises within that time, please let me know.</li>
</ul>

Regarding office hours:
<ul>
<li>If you have any questions regarding the material/homework, please post the question as a discussion item on <a href="https://canvas.iastate.edu/">canvas</a>, or email the me or Haijuan.</li>
<li>My office hours will be held as a Zoom meeting. Please check the home page for our class on <a href="https://canvas.iastate.edu/">canvas</a> for instructions on how to access the Zoom meeting.</li>
<li>Haijuan will be holding an additional office hour each week (time TBD). She will also hold her office hours as a Zoom meeting. Please note that there is a separate link/meeting ID for Haijuan's office hours. Check the home page for our class on <a href="https://canvas.iastate.edu/">canvas</a> for instructions on how to access the Zoom meeting.</li>
</ul>

Regarding the midterm and the final projects:
<ul>
<li>The midterm is now scheduled for April 9th, though the distribution format has yet to be decided.</li>
<li>The plan for final group projects has not changed. I will provide more information on how we will do this at a distance in the next couple of weeks.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Course description:</h4>
  <p>Not all data lives in nice, clean spreadsheets, not all data fits in a computer's main memory. As statisticians we cannot always rely on other people and sciences to get the data into formats that we can deal with: we will discuss aspects of statistical computing as they are relevant for data analysis. Read and work with data in different formats: flat files, databases, web technologies. Elements of literate programming help us with making our workflow transparent and analyses reproducible. We will discuss how to communicate our results in form of R packages and interactive web applications.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    <h4>Learn how to:</h4>
    <ul>
<li>Learn how to deal with complex, messy, real data</li>
<li>Use graphics to explore and understand data</li>
<li>Gain familiarity with basic data collection, storage and manipulation</li>
<li>Fluently reshape data into the most convenient form for analysis or reporting</li>
<li>Automate cleaning and analysis in R.</li>
    </ul>
