<h3>Patterns in Migration</h3>

<p>For our project, we plan on looking at patterns in worldwide migration data from 1960-2018. We will be looking at overall trends in migration numbers for a few large countries as well as how certain events like war, disease, and other major occurrences have impacted migration numbers in various parts of the world. In addition to this, since the dataset also has information on population density and income levels, we will be investigating how these factors are connected to migration. As we work with the data more, we will be deciding whether to keep our investigation fairly broad or give certain topics listed above more focus.</p>
