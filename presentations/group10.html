<h3>Which State should be Number One?</h3>

<p>With the disaster of this year's Iowa Caucus, many have been calling for a change in which state gets the privilege of hosting the first caucus or primary. But what makes the perfect first state? Our group will attempt to answer three questions based on what makes the optimal opening state. First, we will analyze which state is the most evenly split on all aspects of our data, in order to determine what state would create the most balance in ideologies. Then we will
halve our data into looking at the republican versus democrat divide. These two subsets will allow us to find the prime state for each political party to hold their primary in. All in all, we hope to answer the very important question of who should be number one.</p>
