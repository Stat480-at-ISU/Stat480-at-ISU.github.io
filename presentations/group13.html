<h3>Premiums and Driving</h3>

<p>We will be using the "bad_drivers" dataset from fivethirtyeight. Our initial exploration will be looking at the relationship between the number of drivers and the average insurance premiums. The dataset is broad enough in order to satisfy this exploration as well as offers more data for additional exploration.</p>
