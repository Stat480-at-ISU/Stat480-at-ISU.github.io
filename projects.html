<h2>Final  projects</h2><br/><br/>

<p>
The final project consists of a written report and an oral presentation during class time (dead week and Finals' week). </br></br>
Some <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~hofmann/stat480/presentations/presentation-schedule.html">past projects</a> from  Stat 480 students. 
</br></br></br>
</p>

<h4>Final project guidelines:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The final project is a team effort.</li>
  <li>Teams will consist of 3-5 students with the larger the group the longer the written component and presentation will be expected to be.</li>
  <li>With your team, you have to identify both a topic and a suitable data set. (see below)</li>
  <li>The project has a written component with several stages.</li>
  
  <li>A first due date will be after the first week you work on the project, the final write-up is due April 23rd.</li>
  <li>The topic should be within the realm of general knowledge and interest.</li>
  <li>You may revisit one of the topics from class, but take care to try to explore VERY different aspects of the topic and make sure to also get additional/other sources for your data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br/>  

<h4>Data requirements:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The data should have at least 1,000 records and several variables (minimum of 5), preferably of different types. This is to ensure that you will find something of interest in the data.</li>
  <li>The data set has to be available to the graders (TA and instructor). At a minimum, the data summaries and findings have to be made available to all members of the course.</li>
  <li>A dataset is automatically excluded from consideration for the project, if it has been published in a textbook unless permission by the instructor is granted. In that case, you have to ensure that the exploration is sufficiently different from the textbook discussion.</li>
</ul>
